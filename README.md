## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was such a great project to practice Javascript and DOM events, which I needed a refreshed on. I also learnt to use the html <details> and <summary> elements, which are great but it did take some work to figure out the selectors for the js script file. 

### Useful resources

The MDN page on HTMLDetailsElement: toggle event, was a valuable resource. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDetailsElement/toggle_event
